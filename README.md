# Covid19Classifier

## Aim
This project uses Python based CNN classifier in order to classify if given CT Scan image is Covid positive or not

## Resources
The dataset used can be found here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/13gRaUpopoKCGZNypj2otAW70R90irB-m/view?usp=sharing. It is recommended to use Google Colab.
## Description 
The binary classification of Lung CT scans is obtained using a CNN model. The Image generator for the model undergoes Image augmentation before being given as input. The final accuracy obtained is 96.5 percent. This accuracy is not the best since the dataset used is very small. More work is going into this project.

Below are some image predicted correctly.
